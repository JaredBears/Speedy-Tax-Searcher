# Speedy Tax Searcher
This project will automatically retrieve assessment and tax information from public records.  This information is spread out across multiple governmental websites and is time-consuming to manually research.  
While this information can take approximately 10 minutes per property for a person to retrieve from the various websites, this application will retrieve and compile the information in under 1 minute per property.
